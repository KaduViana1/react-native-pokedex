A Pokedex APP!!

This is a react native app using expo with expo router, it uses the PokéAPI(https://pokeapi.co/) to show information about any pokémon and redux-toolkit and redux-persist to manage and persist states.

In the home page you can see an infinite scroll with a grid of little cards with the name, image and the types of every pokémon.
